
 <h1> The Best Movie according to Sa'ad</h1>
 <h2> My Top Movie Franchise</h2>
 <hr />
 <h2>Mission Impossible</h2>
 <p>I love the way its action packed. it involves series of spy action which I always find interesting, always doing the Impossible and fighting against all odds to make it a successuful mission, and <strong>I also love Tom Cruise movies</strong></p>
 
 <h2>Fast and Furiuos</h2>
 <p>One of my main taking into the movie is the family bond they establish even though not all of them are family. <br /> It is filled with series of car driving which involves racing and drifting and the ulitimate racing against Impossible every time</p>

 <h2>The Hunger Games</h2>
 <p>Even though the plot of the movie is a folktale, i love the way they potrait the storyline in a sense where Human are seen as entertainment for those with power and those participating have to find a way to survive amidst series of challenge thrown their way. <br /> It shows what someone can do for their Survival</p>
