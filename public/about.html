<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hey, I'm Saad — a Computer Science student at the Federal University of Technology, currently in my 400 level, which means I’m somewhere between “I got this” and “please send help” when it comes to school. I’m one of those introverts who enjoys the quieter side of life. I don’t talk much unless there’s something really worth saying… or unless we’re debating football.

  <p>I like to keep things simple — in how I dress, how I live, and how I think. That doesn’t mean boring, though. I’ve got a casual kind of humor, the type that sneaks into conversations and catches people off guard. I’m not trying to be the center of attention, but I’ll definitely make you laugh if you’re paying attention.</p>
  
  When I’m not busy writing code or pretending I understand every lecture perfectly, you’ll usually find me doing one of three things: watching movies, watching football, or watching basketball. Movies are kind of my escape — I can binge through genres like it’s a sport. Whether it’s action, thriller, or something weird and artsy, I’m always down for a good story.
  
  Football is a big part of my life too, and if you know me well enough, you already know I ride or die with Real Madrid. Watching them play is both joy and stress, but that’s part of the love, right? I also enjoy basketball — whether it’s watching NBA highlights or just casually talking hoops with friends, I’m into it.</p>
  
  <p>I’m not the loudest person in the room, but I’m observant, curious, and always thinking about the next big idea. I enjoy learning new things, messing around with code, and finding creative ways to solve problems — even if it takes me a few tries (and a few Google searches).
  
  At the end of the day, I’m just a guy who enjoys good vibes, deep conversations, chill moments, and maybe a little banter about sports or tech. Still growing, still figuring things out, but always staying true to myself.</p>
